# Astar-and-Dijkstra

IMPORTANT: I received this file as a take-home assignment where I had to create the path_finder.py file

To run the code: python2.7 challenge_1_test.py --viz

To change the grid and the no. of obstacles, edit the challenge_1_test.py file

uncomment the fScore fundtion in path_finder.py to calculate for Dijkstra or A*
